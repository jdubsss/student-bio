This is my first CSS project.

I heard the instructor mention a varety of tags and other items to use but had no idea on how to actually use them in code.

I asked the TA Deon Sharps to help me and he sat with me as I started the code. He gave me many awesome tips and guided me (no hand holding here) to ensure I knew what I was doing and why I was doing it.

It felt so good to have accomplished this!
